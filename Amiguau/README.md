Amiguau

Many well intending conservation education programs are deployed every year, but not often enough are these programs evaluated for effectiveness. I aim to use the program evaluation surveys from Amiguau to see if the program effects the response to a critical pillar in the prevention of the illegal pet trade industry, “Which animals make good pets?”. Data for this paper is from a non profitconservation organization that focuses on conserving cotton top tamarins, a small monkey native to South America. One of their projects is a program called Amiguau. Amiguau is a kids camp that teaches Colombian youth the difference between wild animals and domestic pets while helping the kids train their dog. The program was created to educate kids on the illegal pet trade happening in their country while providing resources to care for domestic animals already in the community.

Program Evaluation Survey
1. What kind of animals would you like to be given and why?
2. What would you say to someone who wants to give you a Titi Cabeciblanco?
3. If there are Wild animals at home, ask: Yes-No
4. Which animals make good pets? 
5 Would you like to have a white-headed marmoset as a pet? If yes, ask why? And if not, ask why? 
6. How does this program help cotton tops?  7. How does this program help domestic pets?

Getting Started

This is a CHAID decision tree in R to see how their responses to Q1 “What kind of animals would you like to be given and why?” relates to the rest of the survey responses.
